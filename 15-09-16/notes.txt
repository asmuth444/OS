Threads
Easier to make as compared to process.
Thread Library name => pthread.h
each process by default has thread
data type for thread id  is pthread_t
how to make thread?
pthread_create(pthread_t var/id,thread attributes,thread function,thread function argument pointer)

for running pthread use
gcc -pthread -o executable file name

so as to make the new thread join the new thread use pthread_join(name of thread,pointer to the return value of the function)

for passing the variable to the thread use global variable.
